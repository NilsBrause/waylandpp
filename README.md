# Introduction

Wayland is an object oriented display protocol, which features request
and events. Requests can be seen as method calls on certain objects,
whereas events can be seen as signals of an object. This makes the
Wayland protocol a perfect candidate for a C++ binding.

The goal of this library is to create such a C++ binding for Wayland
using the most modern C++ technology currently available, providing
an easy to use C++ API to Wayland.

# Requirements

To build this library, either a recent version of scons or a recent
version of cmake is required, since this library can use either of
them as its build system. Furthermore, a recent C++ Compiler with
C++11 support, such as GCC or clang, is required. Apart from the
Wayland libraries, there are no further library dependencies.

The documentation is autogenerated using Doxygen, therefore doxygen as
well as graphviz is required.

# Building

## With SCons

To build the library, `scons` needs to be executed in the root
directory of the repository. After that, `scons install` will install
the library.

There are several environment variable that can be set in order to
customise the build and install process:

Evirnoment Variable | Effect
------------------- | ------
`CXX`               | C++ compiler for the library
`CXXFLAGS`          | Additionsl flags for the C++ compiler
`CROSSCXX`          | Cross compiler for the library. Does not affect the bindings generator
`CROSSCXXFLAGS`     | Additional flags for the cross compiler
`PKG_CONFIG`        | Path to the pkg-config executable
`ROOT`              | Installation root. Useful for creating distribution packages
`PREFIX`            | Prefix folder, under which everything is installed
`LIBDIR`            | Library folder relative to the prefix
`INCLUDEDIR`        | Header folder relative to the prefix
`BINDIR`            | Binary folder relative to the prefix
`SHAREDIR`          | Shared folder relative to the prefix

To build the example programs, `scons` is executed in the example
directory. If the library is not yet installed, the following
commands can be used to run the example programs from the root
directory of the repository, while a Wayland compositor is running:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src example/opengles
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src example/shm
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src example/dump
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src example/proxy-wrapper

To build the documentation, `doxygen` needs to be executed in the
root directory of the repository. The resulting documentation can
then be found in the `doc` directory. The required Doxyfile is
available after the library has been built. The documentaion is also
online availabe [here](http://nilsbrause.de/waylandpp/).

## With CMake

To build the library, `cmake ..` needs to executed in a newly created
`build` directory in the root directory of the repository, followed 
by a `make`. After that, `make install` will install the library.

For building the examples and the documentation refer to the previous
subsection.

# Usage

In the following, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with
basic Wayland concepts and at least version 11 of the C++
programming language.

Each interface is represented by a class. E.g. the `wl_registry`
interface is represented by the `registry_t` class.

An instance of a class is a wrapper for a Wayland object (a `wl_proxy`
pointer). If a copy is made of a particualr instance, both instances
refer to the same Wayland object. The underlying Wayland object is
destroyed once there are no copies of this object left. Only a few
classes are non-copyable, namely `display_t` and `egl_window_t`.
There are also special rules for proxy wrappers and the use of
foreigen objects. Refer to the documentation for more details.

A request to an object of a specific interface corresponds to a method
in this class. E.g. to marshal the `create_pool` request on an
`wl_shm` interface, the `create_pool()` method of an instance of
`shm_t` has to be called:

    shm_t shm;
    int fd;
    int32_t size;
    // ... insert the initialisation of the above here ...
    shm_pool_t shm_pool = shm.create_pool(fd, size);

Some methods return newly created instances of other classes. In this
example an instance of the class `shm_pool_t` is returned.

Events are implemented using function objects. To react to an event, a
function object with the correct signature has to be assigned to
it. These can not only be static functions, but also member functions
or closures. E.g. to react to global events from the registry using a
lambda expression, one could write:

    registry.on_global() = [] (uint32_t name, std::string interface,
                               uint32_t version)
      { std::cout << interface << " v" << version << std::endl; };

An example for using member functions can be found in
example/opengles.cpp or example/shm.cpp.

The Wayland protocol uses arrays in some of its events and requests.
Since these arrays can have arbitrary content, they are not directly
mapped to a std::vector. Instead there is a new type array_t, which
can converted to and from a std::vectory with an user specified type.
For example:

    keyboard.on_enter() = [] (uint32_t serial, surface_t surface,
                              array_t keys)
      { std::vector<uint32_t> vec = keys; };

To compile code that using this library, pkg-config can be used to
take care of the compiler flags. Assuming the source file is called
`foo.cpp` and the executable shall be called `foo` type:

    $ c++ -c foo.cpp `pkg-config --cflags wayland-client++` -o foo.o
    $ c++ foo.o `pkg-config --libs wayland-client++` -o foo

If the library and headers are installed in the default search paths
of the compiler, the linker flag `-lwayland-client++` can also
directly be specified on the command line.

If the Wayland cursor classes and/or EGL is used, the corresponding
libreries `wayland-cursor++` and/or `wayland-egl++` need to be linked
in as well.
