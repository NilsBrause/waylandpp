/** \example proxy-wrapper.cpp
 * This is an example of how to use the Wayland C++ bindings with multiple threads
 * binding to globals on one shared connection using proxy wrappers.
 *
 * It can run in two modes: safe or unsafe mode. In safe mode, proxy wrappers
 * are correctly used. In unsafe mode, proxy wrappers are not used, and a
 * race occurs that will lead to failures when ran often enough.
