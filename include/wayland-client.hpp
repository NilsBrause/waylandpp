  /** \brief Represents a connection to the compositor and acts as a
      proxy to the display singleton object.

      A display_t object represents a client connection to a Wayland
      compositor. It is created with display_t::display_t(). A
      connection is terminated using display_t::~display_t().

      A display_t is also used as the proxy for the display singleton
      object on the compositor side. A display_t object handles all the
      data sent from and to the compositor. When a proxy_t marshals a
      request, it will write its wire representation to the display's
      write buffer. The data is sent to the compositor when the client
      calls display_t::flush().

      Incoming data is handled in two steps: queueing and
      dispatching. In the queue step, the data coming from the display
      fd is interpreted and added to a queue. On the dispatch step, the
      handler for the incoming event set by the client on the
      corresponding proxy_t is called.

      A display has at least one event queue, called the main
      queue. Clients can create additional event queues with
      display_t::create_queue() and assign proxy_t's to it. Events
      occurring in a particular proxy are always queued in its assigned
      queue. A client can ensure that a certain assumption, such as
      holding a lock or running from a given thread, is true when a
      proxy event handler is called by assigning that proxy to an event
      queue and making sure that this queue is only dispatched when the
      assumption holds.

      The main queue is dispatched by calling display_t::dispatch().
      This will dispatch any events queued on the main queue and attempt
      to read from the display fd if its empty. Events read are then
      queued on the appropriate queues according to the proxy
      assignment. Calling that function makes the calling thread the
      main thread.

      A user created queue is dispatched with
      display_t::dispatch_queue(). If there are no events to dispatch
      this function will block. If this is called by the main thread,
      this will attempt to read data from the display fd and queue any
      events on the appropriate queues. If calling from any other
      thread, the function will block until the main thread queues an
      event on the queue being dispatched.

      A real world example of event queue usage is Mesa's implementation
      of eglSwapBuffers() for the Wayland platform. This function might
      need to block until a frame callback is received, but dispatching
      the main queue could cause an event handler on the client to start
      drawing again. This problem is solved using another event queue,
      so that only the events handled by the EGL code are dispatched
      during the block.

      This creates a problem where the main thread dispatches a non-main
      queue, reading all the data from the display fd. If the
      application would call poll(2) after that it would block, even
      though there might be events queued on the main queue. Those
      events should be dispatched with display_t::dispatch_pending()
      before flushing and blocking.

        Note: It is not possible to check if there are events on the
        main queue or not. For dispatching main queue events without
        blocking, see display_t::dispatch_pending(). Calling this will
        release the display file descriptor if this thread acquired it
        using display_t::acquire_fd().

        \return The number of dispatched events
        \exception std::system_error on failure
      
        This function dispatches events on the main event queue. It
        does not attempt to read the display fd and simply returns zero
        if the main queue is empty, i.e., it doesn't block.
       
        This is necessary when a client's main loop wakes up on some fd
        other than the display fd (network socket, timer fd, etc) and
        calls wl_display_dispatch_queue() from that callback. This may
        queue up events in the main queue while reading all data from
        the display fd. When the main thread returns to the main loop
        to block, the display fd no longer has data, causing a call to
        poll(2) (or similar functions) to block indefinitely, even
        though there are events ready to dispatch.
       
        To proper integrate the wayland display fd into a main loop,
        the client should always call display_t::dispatch_pending() and
        then display_t::flush() prior to going back to sleep. At that
        point, the fd typically doesn't have data so attempting I/O
        could block, but events queued up on the main queue should be
        dispatched.
       
        A real-world example is a main loop that wakes up on a timerfd
        (or a sound card fd becoming writable, for example in a video
        player), which then triggers GL rendering and eventually
        eglSwapBuffers(). eglSwapBuffers() may call
        display_t::dispatch_queue() if it didn't receive the frame
        event for the previous frame, and as such queue events in the
        main queue. Note: Calling this makes the current thread the
        main one.
